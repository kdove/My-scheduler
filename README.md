My-scheduler<br>

Environment Variables used to build and test this project;<br>
VS Code

SECTION ONE: SETTING UP THE ENVIORNMENT AND TESTING THE LINKED PAGES<br>
1.) Initialized repository with Master Branch for project (complete)<br>
2.) Set up standard file structure for project (file struct complete)<br>
3.) Added index.html, style.css, and script.js (standard file structure complete)<br>
4.) Add all enviroment variables to read.me for colaberators/contributers (complete)<br>
5.) Push changes to Master often set timer while in session to push every 45 mins and on exit of the VS IDE<br>
6.) Add a nav bar that displays the current date and time<br>
7.) Create a dic that has an ID<br>
8.) link style sheet / test to ensure the style sheet is working<br>
9.) Test the script.js file by adding the following query to the console: console.log("testing") if the console responds with<br> your quotes text in the console then congratualtions you have linked the script file.<br>
10.) Test the style.css by adding a dramatic color that can not be missed.<br>

SECTION TWO: ESTABLISH CLEAR GOALS FOR ITIRATION #1<br>
1.) My first goal is to get the "todays current date and time" from the function that uses moment.js pass the date and time<br> into the div ID created to hold the date and time on the html page<br>
2.) Add rows for every hour between 9:00 and 5:00 the idea is to display the users working hours<br><br>
3.) set the left field input with the "time"<br>
4.) in the center of the input fields the user can enter "Event Description's"<br>
5.) on the right die of the input field add "Submit" butons<br>
6.) allow the user to click save and store the user input into the local browser storage<br>
7.) Retrive the data from the local storage depsite any refresh or browser end process, test for both conditions<br>

Quick Summary of initial creation mile stones:<br>
The idea is for the My-scheduler app to save the user entry in storage despite any browser end session process or refresh<br> event). My goal is to code the projects first for requirements per the instructions. In the event I have extra time after the<br> functionality is working per the spec provided for the assignment then I will go back and focus on the User Interface/<br> experience.

The below items have not been completed by the deadline for the project submission. I will continue to work on them until<br> they are complete.<br>

SECTION THREE DESIGN AND COLOR: ADD DESIGN AND COLOR ELEMTNS TO THE SCHEDULER TO MAKE IT MORE ASSISTIVE TO USERS<br>
1.) once clicked turn the button a distinct color indicating the schedule is not empty.<br>
Using Conditional statements (use moment.js) change the rows to meet the color cordinated criteria set for the My-scheduler<br> app,<br>
RED=past<br>
YELLOW=present<br>
GREEN=future
