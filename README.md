My-scheduler

Environment Variables used to build and test this project;
VS Code

SECTION ONE: SETTING UP THE ENVIORNMENT AND TESTING THE LINKED PAGES
1.) Initialized repository with Master Branch for project (complete)
2.) Set up standard file structure for project (file struct complete)
3.) Added index.html, style.css, and script.js (standard file structure complete)
4.) Add all enviroment variables to read.me for colaberators/contributers (complete)
5.) Push changes to Master often set timer while in session to push every 45 mins and on exit of the VS IDE
6.) Add a nav bar that displays the current date and time
7.) Create a div that has an ID
8.) link style sheet / test to ensure the style sheet is working
9.) Test the script.js file by adding the following query to the console: console.log("testing") if the console responds with your quotes text in the console then congratualtions you have linked the script file.
10.) Test the style.css by adding a dramatic color that can not be missed.

SECTION TWO: ESTABLISH CLEAR GOALS FOR ITIRATION #1
1.) My first goal is to get the "todays current date and time" from the function that uses moment.js pass the date and time into the div ID created to hold the date and time on the html page //*COMPLETED*//
2.) Add rows for every hour between 9:00 and 5:00 the idea is to display the users working hours //*COMPLETED*//
3.) set the left field input with the "time",//*COMPLETED*//
4.) in the center of the input fields the user can enter "Event Description's",  //*COMPLETED*//
5.) on the right side of the input field add "Submit" butons //*COMPLETED*//
6.) allow the user to click save and store the user input into the local browser storage //*COMPLETED*//
7.) Retrive the data from the local storage depsite any refresh or browser end process, test for both conditions //*COMPLETED*//

Quick Summary of initial creation mile stones:
The idea is for the My-scheduler app to save the user entry in storage despite any browser "end session process" or "refresh event". My goal is to code the projects first for requirements per the instructions. In the event I have extra time after the functionality is working per the spec provided for the assignment then I will go back and focus on the User Interface/ experience.

The below items have not been completed by the deadline for the project submission. I will continue to work on them until they are complete.

SECTION THREE DESIGN AND COLOR: ADD DESIGN AND COLOR ELEMTNS TO THE SCHEDULER TO MAKE IT MORE ASSISTIVE TO USERS
1.) once clicked turn the button a distinct color indicating the schedule is not empty.
Using Conditional statements (use moment.js) change the rows to meet the color cordinated criteria set for the My-scheduler app,
RED=past
YELLOW=present
GREEN=future
